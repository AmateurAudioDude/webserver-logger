### notes: 

If the logging plugin is activated, logging in the background is started automatically after every website reload. By pressing the DATA LOGGER switch button, the screen switches from the signal display to the logging tool. Every frequency change saves the current record (condition: PI code must be read in) in the continually updated list. You can scroll through the logs using the scroll bar on the right. You can download the current logging list in the appropriate format using the CSV or TXT button.
